# Coding bootcamp challenge 1: refactoring marketing agency's website to increase accessibility

## Description

My first bootcamp challenge was to refactor a marketing agency's website to increase accessibility. In order to do so, I re-organized the HTML in a semantic structure, eliminating the <div> tag as much as possible in favor of more descriptive tags. I also consolidated CSS selectors and properties for increased efficiency. I followed the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) best practices for writing alt text for images, keeping the descriptions concise, and hiding decorative icons through null alt text (alt=””). Finally, I tested the website using the Google Chrome Screen Reader extension, and the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool, to verify its accessibility.

## Usage

The website’s URL is https://beastrobel.github.io/challenge-1. A screenshot can be viewed below. In order to review the refactored code, please use Google Chrome DevTools, or refer to the HTML and CSS files in the repository https://github.com/beastrobel/challenge-1.
